# Kernel Test Modules
## Description
A repository I'm using to release test kernel modules I make. I am getting into kernel module development due to interest in the Linux kernel in general and also because [Bifrost}(https://github.com/BifrostTeam), an upcoming firewall my friend and I are working on, will be releasing a kernel module for packet processing.
